                The city of Warri is an oil hub in South-South Nigeria and houses an annex of the Delta State Government House. 
                It served as the colonial capital of the then Warri Province. It shares boundaries with Sapele, Okpe, Ughelli/Agbarho, 
                Udu and Uvwie although most of these places, notably Uvwie, Okpe, and Udu have been integrated into the larger metropolitan 
                area of Warri. Osubi houses an airport that serves the city. Effurun serves as the gateway to and the economic nerve of the city.
                <br>
                The name Warri province was once applicable to the part of an area now called Delta State under the Colony and Protectorate of 
                Southern Nigeria. Its boundary in the Northeast was Sapele/Udu creek near Ughelli and Aboh, with For√ßados River in the Southeast 
                and Jameson Creek in the Southwest which later changed to Delta Province. Warri city is one of the major hubs of petroleum activities 
                and businesses in southern Nigeria. It is a commercial capital city of Delta State, with a population of over 311,970 people according 
                to the national population census figures for 2006.
                <br>
                The city is one of cosmopolitan cities in southern Nigeria originally inhabited and occupied by the Urhobo and Ijaw people.
                Its inhabitants are predominantly Christian of different denominations, and some practice a mixture of African traditional religions 
                like most of Southern Nigeria. The city is known nationwide for its unique Pidgin English.

                <h2>Demographics</h2>
                <p>Warri is regarded as a modern metropolitan area with expanded infrastructural development in other local government areas such as Uvwie, 
                    Udu, and Okpe in recent years, with various road networks linking these places into one. Each of these areas has its own administrative structure.
                    The major people in Warri city are the Urhobo, Itsekiri and Ijaw. However, due to its urban status, there is a large influx of people from all over 
                    the country, most notably the Igbos.</p>
